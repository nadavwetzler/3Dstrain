# OrthoFault
by Nadav Wetzler and Ze'ev Reches

The codes provides a numeric tool to predic the faulting orientation based on energy balancing method between the applied stress and internal dissipate energy by faulting.
We use a series of stress states from three dimensional experiments to show the predicted faulting patterns.

# Input
The progrem loads experiment stress data, the Young modulus and Poisson modules. See 14 datasets in the 'Data' direcory that are obtained from experimental datasets (see reference list).

Output - the predicted orthorhombic orientations 

# To run the code
1) Downlod the package 

2) Use run_OrthoFault.m to run the script

# Theory
We consider an intact, homogeneous, linear elastic, brittle rock, at a quasi-static compressional loading system. The bulk elastic strain energy of the tested rock sample, U, is a product of the applied three-dimensional stresses and the elastic moduli of the rock sample. For simplicity, the analysis refers to the principal stress coordinate system. 
It is suggested that the rock failure by shear along one or more faults is controlled by the conditions formulated by these hypotheses: 

A.	Critical energy: Faulting (i.e., shear fracturing) occurs when U ≥ UC, where U is the elastic energy density generated by the loading system, and UC is the critical energy density necessary for dissipation by the faulting processes. We employ the total elastic energy that incorporates both the mean-stress and the distortion-energy because the failure of brittle rocks strongly depends on the mean-stress and normal stress. 

B.	Strain compatibility: The internal strain-state is compatible with the external, elastic strain-state, that is generated by the external loading stresses. The internal strain is accommodated by slip along the developing faults and by dilation normal to them. 


We search for a fault system that satisfy the above two hypotheses. The search is based on simulations of a single preferred fault that is defined by its normal angles with respect to the three-dimensional axes of the principal stress state. At failure, the rock-body is internally deformed by fault slip along the DS axis and dilation DD normal to it. The faulting energy dissipation is the work done by Ds and Dd under the corresponding stresses applied on the preferred fault. The preferred fault geometry is derived here by a multi-parameter minimization of the differences between the external elastic deformation (strain, and energy), and the internal strain and energy dissipation by the fault
